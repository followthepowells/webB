                           <p>Research on what data to use was centered on Toronto Open source platform. This is where the base geometry of the neighborhoods was obtained as well as the demographic statistics and the education rates, all on a per neighborhood level. The crime rates were found via the Toronto Police Service. Each of the datasets needed to join with the base geometry layer (neighborhoods) as a requirement and was part of the research stipulations we set out with.</p>

                           <h3><strong>Step 2: Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading </strong></h3>
                           <p>For strategic purposes the workload was divided by factor. Each person took on an individual factor to analize and move forward with. Education, crime rate, income level, and cost of housing, were the four factors and workloads delegated amongst the group.  Each person combined their respective source data with the base gemoetry neighborhood data in order to be able to bring it into the mapping environment for further analysis.</p>

                           <h3><strong>Step 3: Application of Cartographic Principles</strong></h3>
                           <p>For the cartographic representations, each individual factor needed to be represented in a comprehensible manner. Each individual factor is put through the AHP Priority Calculator and AHP Pairwise Comparison tool to determine the weighting each one would recieve. The final weighted layer would be the primary focus map and present the user with a thorough understanding of each of the factors and how they influence the decision making process. The user will be able to view all collected information with appropriate background and be able to make a more informed decision about each neighborhood and how attractive it is for development.</p>

                           <p>After finishing up all the modification on ArcGIS pro, we shared the map to ArcGIS Online. Each group members uploaded their outcome on the group content section.</p>

                           <p>Before proceeding to configure the individual web app, the web map was first edited in Map Viewer since there are components that cannot be directly edited on ArcGIS Experience Builder. The final cartographic choices are made in this step. We chose the basemap, modified the colour scheme and symbology, and enabled the legend. </p>

                           <p>The team settled on developing the final solution on ArcGIS Experience Builder. The four web maps displaying individual factors contain the same widgets. This provides potential users with the same experience throughout the solution. The team selected the legend widget to reference the symbology on the map. The chart widget visualizes and compares the quantitative attributes of the different neighborhoods in Toronto. The text widget with dynamic content helps identify the neighborhood selected along with additional information to complement the chart. Finally, the search widget allows the users to approximate the addresses to a neighborhood.</p>

                           <p>The team conducted meetings to ensure that the individual web app maintains the same look and feel. Responsiveness and mobile phone optimization were also considered; three different layouts were set. The first layout is for desktop or laptop displays. In this layout, all the widgets and map are in view, and none can be hidden. The sidebar widget was used for the tablet layout. The text, chart, and legend were all inside the side panel, which can be hidden from view when interacting with the map. The final layout is for small screen devices or mobile phones. The team decided that displaying the dynamic text is sufficient for this view. All the other widgets were moved to the pending list.</p>

                           <p>A single web app was created to make a seamless solution wherein all four factors are accessible using tabs. The final solution combines the individual web app experiences from phase 2 of the project. In ArcGIS Experience Builder, the header was added with a menu widget. Additional pages were created for the individual web apps. The embed widget was inserted into each of the pages. Finally, the URL from each of the web experiences made by the group members were connected using URLs.</p>

                           <p>The team also explored applications, ArcGIS Dashboards and ArcGIS StoryMaps, that could enhance the web map experience. However, there was no time to integrate these enhancements without sacrificing the user experience and the navigability of each map in the final solution. Therefore, the team has decided that only the widgets from step 6 be in the final solution. The images below are enhancements and solutions that did not make it to the final map.</p>

                     <p>Through the use of Experience Builder, it was found that the user interface, though sometimes complicated, does allow for a lot of creative options and expression. One of the major downsides is when modifying the source data on which the 'experience' is built on, the user will more than likely lose all of their work and have to start again. This can be mitigated sometimes through creative editing or appending of new data, but overall, the process is frustrating and through a few attempts at this it looks to be an area where the Experience Builder can be improved upon.</p>

Sometimes it would be the case where you would want the formatting attributes to be shared, but other times they should be able to be 'unlocked' so that they can be set to their own unique value based on the screen setup (resolution or screen size).</p>

                     <p>ArcGIS Experience Builder being an online-based web app solution, does not have any collaborative functionality. Users in the same ArcGIS Online organization cannot edit a user’s web experience. The only workaround I found was to copy the item ID of the web app to be edited, open it using this URL https://experience.arcgis.com/builder/?id={INSERT ItemID Here}, save to my contents, and start editing. Passing the edited content back has the same workflow. Specifications or meetings are guaranteed to be needed when collaborating in Experience Builder.</p>
