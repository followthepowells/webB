                           <p>Research on what data to use was centered on Toronto Open source platform. This is where the base geometry of the neighborhoods was obtained as well as the demographic statistics and the education rates, all on a per neighborhood level. The crime rates were found via the Toronto plice service. Each of the datasets needed to join with the base geometry layer (neighborhoods) as a requirement and was part of the research stipulations we set out with.</p>

                           <p>For strategic purposes the workload was divided by factor. Each person took on an individual factor to analize and move forward with. Education, crime rate, income level, and cost of living, were the four factors and workloads delegated amongst the group.  Each person combined their respective source data with the base gemoetry neighborhood data in order to be able to bring it into the mapping environment for further analysis.</p>

                           <p>For the cartographic representations, each individual factor needed to be represented in a comprehensible manner. Each individual factor is put through the AHP Priority Calculator and AHP Pairwise Comparison tool to determine the weighting each one would recieve. The final weighted layer would be the primary focus map and present the user with a thorough understanding of each of the factors and how they influence the decision making process. The user will be able to view all collected information with appropriate background and be able to make a more informed decision about each neighborhood and how attractive it is for development.</p>

                     <p>Through the use of Experience Builder, it was found that the user interface, though sometimes complicated, does allow for a lot of creative options and expression. One of the major downsides is when modifying the source data on which the 'experience' is built on, the user will more than likely lose all of their work and have to start again. This can be mitigated sometimes through creative editing or appending of new data, but overall, the process is frustrating and through a few attempts at this it looks to be an area where the Experience Builder can be improved upon.</p>

                     <p>When experimenting with the mobile UI setup, it was noticed that certain formatting attributes were shared amongst the various screen setups (desktop, tablet, mobile) and this made it more difficult when you could not adjust these attributes uniquely to each of the different setups (if required).  Sometimes it would be the case where you would want the formatting attributes to be shared, but other times they should be able to be 'unlocked' so that they can be set to their own unique value based on the screen setup (resolution or screen size).</p>

                     <p> Working with Experience Builder was initially challenging for me, but as I gradually began to work and build my experience, I realised the full potential of this product. I also had to devote a significant amount of time to going through the documentation and tutorials in order to master the Experince Builder, i also worked on Dashboard and story map, I also worked on the dashboard and story map, but I found those two products to be very static, so they are relatively simple to create.</p>
